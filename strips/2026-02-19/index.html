Panel 1: FDR: &quot;We are both dimes - also known as ten cent pieces.&quot; / Mercury: &quot;Thank you for joining us on our journey to discover how the world works.&quot;
Panel 2: FDR: &quot;I am worth ten times as much as that Lincoln guy!&quot;
Panel 3: Mercury: &quot;Due to inflation, I am now worth fifty five times my face value.&quot;
Panel 4: FDR: &quot;But - you&#039;re still just a dime! I thought we were worth the same amount.&quot;
Panel 5: Mercury: &quot;Value is much more than face deep. Your mettle counts, you know.&quot;
Panel 6: FDR: &quot;It is true - we are both dimes.&quot; / Mercury: &quot;But not all dimes are created equal.&quot;">
